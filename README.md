# Jurassic Brawl

Jurassic Brawl is a classic 2D multiplayer game in the vein of Nintendo's Super Smash Bros.

The aim of the game is simple: extinguish your lizard brethren using a hail of lethal fireballs and Mike Tyson-like dino headbutts. Grab weapon and health power-ups to ensure you're the last one standing.

We made Jurassic Brawl to recapture the old school console gaming experience of playing together with friends in the same room. Play together with 3 other players on any mobile devices (phones and tablets in both iOS and Android flavours).

Jurassic Brawl was created by [Shih-chieh “CJ” KE](https://github.com/RayCJ87), [Edward YANG](https://github.com/edwardcode) and Richmond Wong
